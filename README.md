# Lab 00: Introduction to GitHub

Welcome to your first lab! This assignment will help you get comfortable with GitHub, the platform we'll use throughout this course to submit assignments.

**This lab is ungraded** - it's just practice to make sure everything is set up correctly.

## What You'll Learn

- How to access your assignment repository
- How to edit files on GitHub
- How to save (commit) your changes

## Instructions

### Step 1: Open Your Repository

You're already here! When you accepted the assignment, GitHub created this personal copy of the repository just for you. No one else can see your work except you and the instructor.

### Step 2: Edit the Introduction File

You need to edit the file called `introduction.md` and fill in some information about yourself.

**Choose ONE of the methods below:**

---

#### Option A: Edit on GitHub.com (Easiest)

1. Click on the file `introduction.md` in the file list above
2. Click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file) in the top-right corner of the file
3. Fill in your answers where it says `[Your answer here]`
4. Scroll down to the **"Commit changes"** section
5. Add a short message like "Added my introduction"
6. Click the green **"Commit changes"** button

Done! Your changes are saved.

---

#### Option B: Use GitHub Desktop

1. **Download GitHub Desktop** from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com) if you haven't already
2. In GitHub Desktop, go to **File → Clone Repository**
3. Find this repository in the list (or paste the URL)
4. Click **Clone**
5. Click **"Open in Visual Studio Code"** (or your preferred text editor)
6. Open `introduction.md` and fill in your answers
7. Save the file
8. Go back to GitHub Desktop - you'll see your changes listed
9. At the bottom-left, type a message like "Added my introduction"
10. Click **"Commit to main"**
11. Click **"Push origin"** at the top

Done! Your changes are now on GitHub.

## Step 3: Verify Your Work

Go back to your repository on GitHub.com and click on `introduction.md`. You should see your answers there. If you do, you've successfully completed the lab!

---

## Troubleshooting

**I don't see my changes on GitHub.com**
- If you used GitHub Desktop, make sure you clicked "Push origin" after committing

**I made a mistake**
- No problem! Just edit the file again and make a new commit. You can make as many commits as you want.

**I'm stuck**
- Reach out to the instructor for help
